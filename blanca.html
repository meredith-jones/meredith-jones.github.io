  <h2>Features of this hike:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>This hike is much more difficult to get to, since the road to the trailhead is washed out. Hikers now start at the washout, extending their trip.</li>
      <li>The color of the lake is a bright-light-seafoam green</li>
      <li>If you jump in the lake, it will (probably literally) take your breath away. But it feels great on a hot day!</li>
    </ul>
