      <p>I took a look at <a href="http://www.wta.org/">wta.org</a>, which is the Washington Trails Association. The site is fairly easy to navigate, it has a good nav bar at the top with drop-down menus, it has a search box at the top as well, and then a slide show of featured articles. It also has a side bar with trail work parties, and latest trip reports. I feel it is a good site because it is easy to navigate, provides a lot of good information up front. I go back and forth between thinking it is too busy and thinking it's good to have so much info on the home page. It is kind of nice to be able to find what you need on the home page without having to go several clicks deep. On the other hand, it is a lot to look at and takes some getting used to.</p>
      <p>Upon inspecting element, the HTML is definitely much more complex because it includes CSS, and script tags for JS (whereas my site is entirely HTML at this point). One thing I noticed about the HTML was the extensive use of div tags. I've actually noticed that about a lot of websites whose source I looked at, and am wondering why they don't use more specific tags. It appears as though the default tag to use is div.</p>
