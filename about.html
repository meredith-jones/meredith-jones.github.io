<article id="bio">
<p>I'm a hiking and coding enthusiast! I grew up in SoCal, and have lived in Utah, Texas, Washington, and am currently living in the SF Bay Area. I have an awesome husband named Derek, who I met in the West Coast Swing Dancing community.</p>
<p>I fell in love with hiking (and coding, actually) when I was living in Washington! I love being outside, and taking pictures of nature. I also enjoy dancing, sleeping, and drinking quality coffee. Below is a pic of me atop Mount Ellinor!</p>
